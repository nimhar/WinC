# WinC - Words in Context

WinC is a video-based search engine developed in 2016, whose original purpose was practice for language and vocabulary tests.

The software emphasizes the context of the word within its various uses: how the word sounds, how it can be read, how it is used in different sentences and in what situation it is said.

When one learns the words in this way, it turns out that it is much easier to remember! 

## Instructions

For running the app on your computer you must have Java enviroment. it can be found in here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html

If you already have an enviroment:

Download the files and store them at the same folders as the repository is arranged (the code is not neccesery), and run Winc.jar.



## Screenshots

Finally, the video will be played! 

It will start 5-10 seconds before the requested sentence and will be heard until it ends. 

The user can watch it again, using the "Play the sentence again" button.
