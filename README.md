# WinC - Words in Context

Winc is a video-based search engine, whose original purpose was practice for language and vocabulary tests.

The software emphasizes the context of the word within its various uses: how the word sounds, how it can be read, how it is used in different sentences and in what situation it is said.

When one learns the words in this way, it turns out that it is much easier to remember!
